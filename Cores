Core description and mechanisms they use.

Risk-Reward Core 
Evaluate risk-reward ratio


Market Crash Core
Check for patterns daily and pass signal to other cores to stop operations
Determine best course of action and prepare
Schizo Core (need to limit quantity)
Analyze wallstreetbets (I`ll probably use Gumloop or smth simillar) to determine stock and action. Count similar occurances. Transfer data to risk-reward management core and actually evaluate.
Probably will use it on a week span.
