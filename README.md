# YOLO
My first take on Machine Learning and fintech. Little pet project
Point of project is creating market bot with multiple cores adapting different strategies responding to different scenarios. 
Risk-reward management: comparing potential reward to risk. At the same time high risk moves should be controlled (I`ll probably do it by limiting amount of money that algorithm could spend on single risky move)
I`ll use Quasiconnect API key and python for this project.
